# Terraform Templates for Integration Testing

The Terraform templates deploy the following resources in Azure for integration testing:
- [PostgreSQL database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/deploy-postgresql-flexible-server-database?tabs=azure-cli)
- Databricks secret scope with credentials for PostgreSQL database
- Databricks job that generates synthetic data and writes it to the PostgreSQL database

## Deployment Instructions

1. Install Databricks CLI and configure authentication to Azure Databricks workspace. Set your profile name in providers.tf. The default profile name is "az_dbx".

2. Install the Azure CLI and authenticate.

```sh
az login
```

3. [Set the Azure subscription ID](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/4.0-upgrade-guide#specifying-subscription-id-is-now-mandatory) for the Terraform Azure Provider, which is required starting with v4.0. An environment variable is used to avoid putting the subscription ID in source control.

```sh
# Bash etc.
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=00000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

4. Navigate to the tests/iac folder

```
cd tests/iac
```

5. Initialize Terraform

```sh
terraform init -upgrade
```

6. Create Terraform execution plan
```sh
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
```

7. Apply Terraform execution plan
```sh
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

## Delete Resources

1. Verify the execution plan before deleting resources

```sh
terraform plan -destroy
```

2. Delete resources

```sh
terraform destroy
```
